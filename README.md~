Introduction to R
=================

Friday 11 July, 2014




Overview
--------

R is a powerful programming language for data analysis, with a wide array of applications available for biological sciences. In this workshop we will cover the fundamentals of scientific computing in R. We will start with some basic programming and data exploration, building up to more advanced tools for data visualisation and basic statistical analysis. The workshop assumes no prior programming experience, and the material is applicable across any discipline. The attendees will gain enough knowledge to apply specific tools for their own research.

The workshop will be held in a computing lab in the Charles Perkins Centre at the University of Sydney. It will be run by Sebastian Duchene (sebastian.duchene@sydney.edu.au), with assistance from A/Prof Simon Ho (simon.ho@sydney.edu.au) and Frank Jia (fangzhi.jia@sydney.edu.au). The workshop will involve a series of lectures and tutorials. The tutorials will involve basic analyses and data manipulation using desktop PCs. We will be using free software that can be installed on PC, Mac, and UNIX platforms.
